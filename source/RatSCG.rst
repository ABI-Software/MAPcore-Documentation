Overview
********

Mapping of neuroanatomical connectivity is illustrated using rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG) data from Steve Lewis’ group at CWRU and rat brainstem data from Don Bolser’s group at UFL. This knowledge is assimilated into the SPARC SciGraph, to demonstrate cross-domain data linkage. The Bolser and Lewis work has three major areas of physiological complementarity:

**Larynx/Trachea**: The sensory (Bolser) and motor (Lewis) limbs of protective mechanisms for the upper respiratory tract are captured in the connectivity model. 

**Carotid Body**: Chemosensing for oxygen partial pressure by the Carotid Body is key to respiratory control (Bolser). The SCG (Lewis) sends effector projections to the Carotid Body that modulate its chemosensing.

**Carotid Sinus**: Non-intuitively, blood pressure sensing by the carotid sinus is also key to respiratory control (Bolser). The SCG (Lewis) sends effector projections to the Carotid Sinus that modulate its barosensing.

Knowledge that links the above pathways provides a key means to discover multiple datasets (usually siloed behind institutional and collaborative divides) in these diverse physiology domains.
