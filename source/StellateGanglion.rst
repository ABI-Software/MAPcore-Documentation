Overview
********

Mouse stellate ganglion neuronal cell shape data from the Shivkumar/Tompkins group are displayed in a 3D stellate scaffold. 15 neurons, including their cell bodies, axons and dendrites, are displayed on five cross-sections of the stellate with the high resolution image displayed as a texture map. Electrophysiological data from these cells can be visualized by clicking on the cell. *Note* that the scaffold in this example is a geometrically simple shape designed to register the images in the appropriate anatomical location. The shape of the scaffold will be improved once more data are available to define the stellate boundaries.   

This document guides a user of the SPARC Data Portal through the steps required to discover a collection of segmented cell bodies from the stellate ganglion which have been mapped to a common coordinate framework for visualization purposes. The user is able to discover any electrophysiology data that has been recorded for each of the cell bodies.

Working with the interface
**************************
This section explains how to use more specific features of the interface.

.. todo::
      Highlight features/capabilities that are particular to this use-case.

:ref:`Flatmap-Viewer`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The :ref:`Flatmap-Viewer` represents a high-level view of overall connectivity of the autonomic nervous system.
	
:ref:`Scaffold-Viewer`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:ref:`Scaffold-Viewer` is used to view the anatomical organ scaffold of the specific organ selected on the Flatmap.
	
:ref:`Data-Viewer`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This viewer is used to view the *Electrocardiograph* data recorded with the experiment video. Refer the section :ref:`Data-Viewer`.
