    fill in peter's summary of this use case.
    add link to final portal URL that takes user straight to this dataset display.

This document guides a user of the SPARC Data Portal through the steps required to discover a collection of segmented cell bodies from the stellate ganglion which have been mapped to a common coordinate framework for visualization purposes. The user is able to discover any electrophysiology data that has been recorded for each of the cell bodies.


Step-by-step instructions 
*************************

Follow these step-by-step instructions to familiarise yourself with the flow of the web interface.

**Step 1**. Click on the **Stellate Ganglion** on the Flatmaps window.

**Step 2**. A new window will pop-up i.e. Organs Viewer which displays the anatomical organ scaffold of the stellate.

Working with the interface
**************************

.. todo::
    This should just be links to the flatmap, organ, and data plotting viewer documents. Probably even the chart pane section below doesn't need to be here?

Chart Pane
^^^^^^^^^^

This viewer is used to view the *Electrocardiograph* data recorded with the experiment video.

* Refine the view by draging over a region of interest.
