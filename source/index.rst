MAP visualisation and interaction on the SPARC Data Portal
==========================================================

The `SPARC Portal <https://data.sparc.science>`_ provides interactive access to a growing collection of data, maps, and computational studies that focus on the role of the autonomic nervous system in controlling organ function. These resources are made available to the public with the intent of advancing bioelectronic medicine towards more precise treatment of diseases and conditions.

Here, we provide instructions on how to use the various `map visualization and interaction tools <https://data.sparc.science/map>`_ available on the SPARC Portal, as well as detailed instructions guiding users of the portal through specific exemplar use cases. These specific use cases highlight various types of data and visualizations that are available.

A collection of introductory videos are available on the `MAP-Core YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYlrpP6SrWL0kDZ31we_sqw>`_.
