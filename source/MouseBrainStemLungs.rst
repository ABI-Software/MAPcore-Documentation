Overview
********

A 3D scaffold of the mouse thoracic cavity created using segmentation of longitudinal microCT scans from the SIMBA VIA (Vision and Image Analysis) public database is visualized in the webGL window. The trachea and main bronchi are also shown as rings of segmented points. Confocal stained images from Taylor-Clark group for mouse lungs are embedded into the scaffold. The confocal images were obtained from the right middle lobe (RML). The scaffold was registered to ensure alignment with the airway branch visible on the confocal. This use-case will be the first of many that link the organ systems with the brain stem.
